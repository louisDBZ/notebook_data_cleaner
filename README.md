# notebook data cleaner

It's possible to push on github sensible information located on the results of Notebook

I quickly coded a prototype that deletes all the results-block of a notebook before puhing to github for data privacy

I wonder if there is functionality using jupyter notebook which already does that (or a CI/CD tool), otherwise,if you manifest your interest, I will develop the idea.
